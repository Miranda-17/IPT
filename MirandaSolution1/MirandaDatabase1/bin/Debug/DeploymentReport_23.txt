     Possible data issues
       The type for column OrderId in table [dbo].[Order] is currently  NVARCHAR (50) NOT NULL but is being changed to 
         NVARCHAR (10) NOT NULL. Data loss could occur and deployment may fail if the column contains data that is incompatible
         with type  NVARCHAR (10) NOT NULL.
